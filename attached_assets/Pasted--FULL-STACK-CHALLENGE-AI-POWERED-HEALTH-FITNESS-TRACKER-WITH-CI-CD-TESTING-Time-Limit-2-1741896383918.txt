🚀 FULL-STACK CHALLENGE: AI-POWERED HEALTH & FITNESS TRACKER WITH CI/CD & TESTING 🔥
⏳ Time Limit: 24 Hours
🎯 Goal: Build a fully automated health & fitness tracking platform that integrates real-time activity monitoring, personalized AI-driven recommendations, social challenges, and secure medical data storage. The system must be fully tested, deployed with CI/CD, and monitored in production.

📌 PART 1: BUILD A HEALTH & FITNESS TRACKING APPLICATION
🔥 Mandatory Requirements:
Frontend:

Use React.js (Next.js preferred) or Vue.js for a mobile-responsive UI.
Implement server-side rendering (SSR) and lazy loading for performance optimization.
Use TailwindCSS or Material UI for a clean and modern design.
Provide real-time charts (D3.js / Chart.js) for activity tracking.
Backend:

Use Node.js (NestJS preferred), Django, or FastAPI for backend logic.
Implement GraphQL & REST APIs for flexible data retrieval.
Use WebSockets for real-time workout session tracking.
Integrate OpenAI (GPT) or TensorFlow.js for AI-based workout suggestions.
Database:

Use PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing user health data securely.
Implement Redis for caching & fast queries.
Store real-time activity logs in Time-Series DB (InfluxDB/TimescaleDB).
Authentication & Security:

Implement OAuth 2.0, JWT, and biometric authentication.
Use RBAC with different roles: User, Trainer, and Admin.
Encrypt health data using AES-256.
Secure API with rate-limiting, CORS, and CSRF protection.
📌 PART 2: AI-POWERED HEALTH RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM
🔥 Mandatory Requirements:
Personalized AI-Based Recommendations:

Train a machine learning model for workout and diet recommendations based on user activity.
Adapt recommendations using real-time health metrics.
Automated Diet & Workout Plans:

Generate AI-based meal plans based on BMI, activity level, and goals.
Provide customized workout routines (cardio, strength, yoga).
Social Fitness Challenges & Leaderboards:

Users can compete in daily/weekly fitness challenges.
Implement leaderboards & real-time rankings with WebSockets.
📌 PART 3: TESTING, CI/CD, AND DEPLOYMENT
🔥 Mandatory Requirements:
Unit Testing (Backend & Frontend):

Use Jest & Supertest (Node.js) or Pytest (Django/FastAPI) for backend tests.
Use React Testing Library & Cypress for frontend testing.
Achieve 85%+ code coverage.
Integration & E2E Testing:

Simulate user workouts & diet tracking using Cypress/Puppeteer.
Validate real-time updates in activity tracking.
CI/CD Pipeline (Automated Deployments):

Use GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or Jenkins for automated testing and deployment.
Deploy to AWS (EKS + RDS), GCP (Cloud Run + Firestore), or Azure (AKS).
Implement Blue-Green Deployment & Rollbacks for zero downtime.
Integrate Sentry & Prometheus for monitoring.
📌 PART 4: PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION & SCALABILITY
🔥 Mandatory Requirements:
Global Load Balancing:

Use AWS ALB, Cloudflare Load Balancer, or Nginx Reverse Proxy.
Database Optimization:

Implement query caching & indexing.
Use sharding for high-volume user data.
Stress Testing:

Simulate 1 million+ active users using k6 or Artillery.
